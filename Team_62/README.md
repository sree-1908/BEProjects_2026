Smart Handled Camera System
A web-based smart camera platform built using Flask and Picamera2, providing live video streaming, image
capture, and video recording through a browser-based dashboard. Captured media is automatically uploaded to a
remote PHP server and removed from local storage.

Overview
The Smart Handled Camera System allows users to remotely control a camera connected to a Raspberry Pi or
similar device. The system exposes a REST-based API and an MJPEG video stream, which are consumed by a
responsive HTML dashboard.

Key Features
- Live MJPEG camera streaming via browser
- Remote start and stop of camera
- Image capture with automatic upload
- Video recording with start and stop control
- User-based recording validation
- Automatic cleanup of local media files
- Web dashboard for real-time control and preview
- CORS-enabled API for cross-origin access
- Cloudflare tunnel support for public exposure
